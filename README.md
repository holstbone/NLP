A.1 Movie Reviews: A First Vectorized Representation

This first paper in Natural Language Processing (NLP) begins with the very basic idea of
identifying common terms, themes and ideas within a “corpus”, or collection of documents. It is
important that there is a common corpus vocabulary so that information and knowledge are
effectively communicated. With this goal in mind, we embark on analyzing a corpus (200
documents) of movie reviews that have been collected. Our end goal and final application of
analyzing this corpus, while not yet entirely clear, reveals some of the challenges and tools that
result. With the work described in this paper, we have taken the first step towards better NLP by
identifying terms which are good candidates for a useful corpus vocabulary.
